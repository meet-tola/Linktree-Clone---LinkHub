Welcome to the Linkhub project! This project is a demonstration of how to build a web application similar to Linktree, where users can create a simple landing page with links to their social profiles and other websites. The project utilizes Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Supabase for its development. Through this project, you will learn how to set up user authentication, store user data, and create dynamic user profiles.


### DEMO

[![Nextjs Landing Page Template Screenshot](public/assets/images/linktree-clone-link-hub.png?raw=true)](https://linktree-clone-link-hub.vercel.app/)

Check out our [live demo](https://linktree-clone-link-hub.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
